    Title: Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
    Content: |
      I'm a seasoned software engineer with 8 years of experience spanning aerospace, fintech, and defense. Currently I develop testing software for spacecraft with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington D.C. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

      I love software engineering. I've gotten very good at tackling unconventional technical challenges and thinking about them from several levels of scope at the same time. 
      
      I'll be posting here about my projects, processes, and passions.
